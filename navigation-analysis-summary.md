## 🚀 Testing Recommendations

Test these common navigation commands in AI chat:
1. "go to students" → Should navigate to `/users/students`
2. "add new class" → Should navigate to `/academic/classes/add`
3. "mark attendance" → Should navigate to `/attendance/mark`
4. "show analytics" → Should navigate to `/ai/analytics`
5. "dashboard" → Should navigate to `/`

Test database queries:
1. "how many students do we have?"
2. "show all teachers"
3. "list classes"

Test general conversation:
1. "hello"
2. "what can you do?"
3. "help with attendance"

## 📌 Next Steps

1. **Copy the prompt** from `ai-navigation-instructions.md` into your n8n AI agent
2. **Test navigation** commands through the AI chat interface
3. **Fine-tune** the route aliases based on user feedback
4. **Add more** complex navigation patterns as needed
5. **Implement** database query functionality through AI Agent Tool
6. **Monitor** user interactions to improve command recognition

---

## 💡 Tips for AI Agent Configuration

1. **System Prompt**: Use the entire content of `ai-navigation-instructions.md`
2. **Response Format**: Ensure AI returns pure JSON for navigation (no markdown)
3. **Database Access**: Configure AI Agent Tool with proper database credentials
4. **Error Handling**: Add fallback responses for unrecognized commands
5. **Logging**: Track navigation requests to improve aliases
